A 2D verlet integration based rope simulation for Godot 4.3+.

The computation-heavy simulation part is written in C++ using GDExtension, the rest in GDScript. This allows for fast processing and easy extendability, while keeping the code readable.

The last Godot 3.x version can be found on the [3.x branch](https://github.com/mphe/GDNative-Ropesim/tree/3.x), however, this version is no longer maintained.

## Setup

1. Download the addon
    * From the [Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2334)
    * From the [Beta Asset Store](https://store-beta.godotengine.org/asset/mphe/gdnative-ropesim/)
    * From the [Release Page](https://github.com/mphe/GDNative-Ropesim/releases/latest)
    * From [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/mphe/GDNative-Ropesim/actions) (for preview builds mostly)
2. Move `addons/ropesim` to your project's `addons/` directory
3. Enable the addon in the project settings
4. Possibly restart Godot

## Documentation and Usage

### Nodes

The following nodes exist:
* `Rope`: The basic rope node. Optionally renders the rope using `draw_polyline()`.
* `RopeAnchor`: Always snaps to the specified position on the target rope. Optionally, also adapts to the rope's curvature. Can be used to attach objects to a rope.
* `RopeHandle`: A handle that can be used to control, animate, or fixate parts of the rope.
* `RopeRendererLine2D`: Renders a target rope using `Line2D`.
* `RopeCollisionShapeGenerator`: Can be used e.g. in an `Area2D` to detect collisions with the target rope.
* `RopeInteraction`: Handles mutual interaction of a target node with a rope. Useful for rope grabbing or pulling mechanics where an object should be able to affect the rope and vice-versa.

**NOTE:** All rope related tools automatically pause themselves when their target rope is paused to reduce computation costs and improve performance.

Use the in-engine help to view the full documentation for each node.

### Examples
The project includes various example scenes that demonstrate the features of this plugin.
See also the [showcase video](#showcase) for a basic usage example.

### Editor Menu
When one of the above nodes is selected, a "*Ropesim*" menu appears in the editor toolbar with the following options:
* `Preview in Editor`: Toggle live preview in the editor on or off.
* `Reset Rope`: Reset the selected rope to its resting position.
